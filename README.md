# Self Supervised Learning for Fine grained Classification

As part of our project we have worked on using self supervised learning for fine grained classification of cassava leaves diseases. We've explored 3 different methods for applying self supervised learning - 
- SRGAN
- Jigsaw as pretext task
- SimCLR

The features learnt during the pretext task are fine tuned for downstream classification. The code is separated into these 3 folders.

Our Baseline is a supervised fine grained classification model [Fine-Grained Visual ClassiÔ¨Åcation via Progressive Multi-Granularity Training of Jigsaw Patches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03836).

## Dataset

We have used the cassava leaves fine grained diseases dataset from Kaggle. The dataset has ~12K unlabelled images (extraimages.zip) and ~6K labelled images (train.zip).
The dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/cassava-disease/data). It has 5 disease classes as shown in the following order - cbb,cbsd,cgm,cmd,healthy

<img src = "images/cbb.jpg" alt = "cbb" width ="100" /> &nbsp; <img src = "images/cbsd.jpg" alt = "cbsd" width ="100" /> &nbsp; <img src = "images/cgm.jpg" alt = "cgm" width ="100" /> &nbsp; <img src = "images/cmd.jpg" alt = "cmd" width ="100" /> &nbsp; <img src = "images/healthy.jpg" alt="healthy" height = "133" width ="100" />

For the pretext task training, we've used the extra images (unlabelled). For the downstream task training, we've used the train images (labelled).

## General dependencies
```
python >= 3.6
torch
torchvision
PIL

```

## How to run

We've included the code in the form of Jupyter notebooks to make it easy to visualize and run each cell. Further instructions have been provided in the README files of each folder.
