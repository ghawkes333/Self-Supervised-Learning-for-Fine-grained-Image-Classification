# Self Supervised Learning for Fine grained Image Classification

As part of our project we have worked on using self supervised learning for fine grained classification of cassava leaves diseases. We've explored 3 different methods for applying self supervised learning - 
- [SRGAN](https://github.com/rush2406/Self-Supervised-Learning-for-Fine-grained-Image-Classification/tree/master/SRGAN)
- [Jigsaw as pretext task](https://github.com/rush2406/Self-Supervised-Learning-for-Fine-grained-Image-Classification/tree/master/Jigsaw_as_Pretext_task)
- [SimCLR](https://github.com/rush2406/Self-Supervised-Learning-for-Fine-grained-Image-Classification/tree/master/SimCLR)

The features learnt during the pretext task are fine tuned for downstream classification. The code (implemented in Pytorch) is separated into these 3 folders.

Our Baseline is a supervised fine grained classification model [Fine-Grained Visual ClassiÔ¨Åcation via Progressive Multi-Granularity Training of Jigsaw Patches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03836).

Do give a read at the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13973) for more details and analysis!

## Dataset

We have used the cassava leaves fine grained diseases dataset from Kaggle. The dataset has ~12K unlabelled images (extraimages.zip) and ~6K labelled images (train.zip).
The dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/cassava-disease/data) and [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/cassava-leaf-disease-classification/data?select=train_images). It has 5 disease classes as shown in the following order - cbb,cbsd,cgm,cmd,healthy

<img src = "images/cbb.jpg" alt = "cbb" width ="100" /> &nbsp; <img src = "images/cbsd.jpg" alt = "cbsd" width ="100" /> &nbsp; <img src = "images/cgm.jpg" alt = "cgm" width ="100" /> &nbsp; <img src = "images/cmd.jpg" alt = "cmd" width ="100" /> &nbsp; <img src = "images/healthy.jpg" alt="healthy" height = "133" width ="100" />

For the pretext task training, we've used the extra images (unlabelled). For the downstream task training, we've used the train images (labelled).
