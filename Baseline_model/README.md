# Fine-Grained Visual ClassiÔ¨Åcation via Progressive Multi-Granularity Training of Jigsaw Patches (PMG)

We have chosen our baseline to be PMG. It uses a multigranularity jigsaw to learn fine grained features from a coarse to fine manner.
An accuracy of 88% was obtained after training on the train.zip images of the dataset
