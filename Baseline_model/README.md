# Fine-Grained Visual ClassiÔ¨Åcation via Progressive Multi-Granularity Training of Jigsaw Patches (PMG)

We have chosen our baseline to be PMG. It uses a multigranularity jigsaw to learn fine grained features in a coarse to fine manner.
An accuracy of 88% was obtained after training on the train.zip images of the dataset

## To run

Download the train images from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/cassava-disease/data?select=train.zip) <br/>
